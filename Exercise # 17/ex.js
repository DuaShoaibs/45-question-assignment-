//EXERCISE # 17:>
//More Guests: You just found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is available. Think of three more guests to invite to dinner.
//• Start with your program from Exercise 15. Add a print statement to the end of your program informing people that you found a bigger dinner table.
//• Add one new guest to the beginning of your array.
//• Add one new guest to the middle of your array. • Use append() to add one new guest to the end of your list. • Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.
// Original guest list
var guestList = ["zainab", "zunaira", "laiba", "sana", "ifra", "mirha", "dua"];
console.log("Sorry, we can only invite two people for dinner.");
while (guestList.length > 2) {
    var removedGuest = guestList.pop();
    console.log("Sorry, ".concat(removedGuest, ", we can't invite you to dinner."));
}
for (var _i = 0, guestList_1 = guestList; _i < guestList_1.length; _i++) {
    var guest = guestList_1[_i];
    console.log("Dear ".concat(guest, ", you're still invited to dinner."));
}
guestList.pop();
guestList.pop();
console.log("Updated guest list:", guestList);
