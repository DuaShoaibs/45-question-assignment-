//EXERCISE # 12:>

//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names: string[] = ["Zainab", "Dua", "Laiba", "Zunaira", "Ifra"];
console.log("Message for my friends:");
for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) 
console.log(`Hello, ${names[i]}! Are you alive?`);
